# traccar-api-php
Use traccar api with php.

The current supported version of Traccar Server Version is 3.15

This is an effort towards implementing support for Traccar API in PHP.

Apart from just providing the functions and libraries or class for it, I am also providing working examples and usage of Traccar API using PHP.

There will also be working examples of Map based Live Tracking and various other UI Implementations as well.
